# Spotify clone
A simple and responsive Spotify Clone created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the basic user interface and features of Spotify, 
showcasing how a music streaming platform can be built with front-end web technologies.

# Overview
This project mimics the look and feel of Spotify's main interface. While it doesn't integrate with Spotify's API or allow users to stream actual music,
it demonstrates how you can create a dynamic, interactive music player interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Features
1. Responsive Design: The interface is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
2. Music Player Controls: Basic player controls (play/pause, next/previous track, volume control).
3. Track List: Display a list of songs with titles and artist names.
4. Track Navigation: Users can click through tracks to change the current song.
5. Custom Styling: Custom CSS styling to make the interface visually similar to Spotify.
 
# Technologies Used
1. HTML: Used to structure the content of the page, including navigation, track lists, and buttons.
2. CSS: Used for styling the user interface to resemble Spotify's design.
3. JavaScript: Used to handle functionality such as track changes, play/pause functionality, and other interactive elements.

# Usage
Once you open the project, you will see a Spotify-like interface. You can:
1. Play and pause songs by clicking the play/pause button.
2. Navigate between tracks using the next/previous buttons.
3. Adjust the volume and other player controls.
4. Note that this clone is only a front-end mockup and doesn't support actual music streaming or integration with Spotify's API.
